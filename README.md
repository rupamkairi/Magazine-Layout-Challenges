# Magazine Layout Challenges

## The name speaks for itself.
Project is all about making good-looking magazine type web-pages.

### Techs used
- HTML/CSS/JS
- tailwindcss grids flex and media

why tailwind?
because they provide the most utility css out of the box and consistency throghout the challenges. 

Don't know when or how often I am going to update this repo but stick around.
